# simulation

Simulation app to compute a risk loss score for revenue.

We are running 500 trials with probable revenue for this month. We then filter
the trials for revenue variance that puts us in the red. From there we compute
a risk loss probability to share with stakeholders. 

The app is available at https://jnorm.shinyapps.io/ProfitLossSim/
