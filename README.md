# simulation

I developed a simulation app to compute a risk loss score for revenue. We can make smart business decisions when we have insight into the probabilities of a scenario. This app allows us to run up to 1,000 trials (probability scenarios) with probable revenue for the current month as the input. We then filter a risk loss probability that tells us the probability that our revenue variance will lead to profit or loss. For simplicity in this demonstration, the fixed and variable costs and their deviation are set in advance.

The app is available at https://jnorm.shinyapps.io/ProfitLossSim/
